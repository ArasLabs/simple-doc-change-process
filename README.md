# DocChange Process - Simplified Doc Release Workflow

This Add-On Package adds a simplified change and release process for documents (only).

It loads on top of the standard "Product Engineering" solution and can be used in parallel with the standard change management there.

Identity "DocChange Management" has "World" listed so all users can work with DocChanges. You may want to replace "World" with other identities more suitable.

It will extend the life cycle map of documents and add a shorter workflow with "Fast Track" and "Review" options.

If author (owned_by) and Responsible (managed_by) are set on documents, these identities will automatically be added to the review activities of the workflow.
